## Usage
Every folder will have a set of Markdown files that explain different aspects of diverse web development frameworks and tools.

## Note about information sources
Inside of the guides, I use information from different sources, such as Stack Overflow, documents provided by different proffesors from my university (UOC and ULL), and many others. This said, I try to mix everything together properly with examples I'm working on for different classes and personal projects.
